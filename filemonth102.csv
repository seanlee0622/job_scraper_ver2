Sentinel is one of the DoD’s newest official “programs of record,” having recently achieved Acquisitions Milestone B and enjoys broad, strong support at the national level. It is a long-term project with the weapon system anticipated to deploy over a nine-year period beginning in 2026 and remaining operational until at least 2075. Sentinel is a career defining program that will present unique and challenging opportunities that are simply not available with smaller projects.
