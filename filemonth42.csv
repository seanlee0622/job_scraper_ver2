We believe that as quickly as you can hail a ride with your phone, you should be able to have a plumber check out your leaky faucet. We are building a platform for experts to provide remote, on-demand services to their customers, saving time and money, and providing a better overall experience for both parties. * But Streem goes a step further. By bringing together some of the latest technologies in a convenient and easy to use app, we are revolutionizing communication beyond just normal remote video. Using Augmented Reality, now the plumber can literally reach out and point at the problem area, instead of trying to explain with just words. They can also take remote measurements, because Streem is capturing depth information during the call. Using Machine Learning and Image Recognition, we can identify products, extract model/serial numbers, recognize problems situations, and more, making the expert even more efficient than if they were onsite. * Does this sound like a product and vision you want to be a part of?

Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to infer biological relationships. By commanding massive experimental scale — up to millions of wet lab experiments weekly — and massive computational scale — owning and operating one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, Recursion is uniting technology, biology and chemistry to advance the future of medicine. *  Eight years ago, Recursion was manufacturing and staining plates by hand. Today, we're able to process and scan more than a million experiments every week. In the last year we've been able to take a compound from screen to preclinical data package in almost six months and put multiple molecules in the clinic with line of sight to our impact on patients. Next, we are building a Digital Chemistry team to help translate biology inferences to discovery leads and advance pharmaceutical projects in unprecedented fashion. Our drug discovery strategies are map and data-driven rather than target and exec-driven, revealing destinations you might never have considered. It is an audacious goal, but it isn't a dream or science fiction. We're already doing it! *  While we offer cutting-edge tools and an amazing lab, the secret sauce is our people.
