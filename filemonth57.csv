Nusano represents the first true turning point in the history of the field of radioisotope manufacturing since the advent of the cyclotron. By augmenting a standard linear accelerator with a proprietary high-current multiparticle ion source, our solution can generate radioisotopes with a very high yield and specific activity and is poised to become the state-of-the-art technology.*Our technology is uniquely suited for the generation of therapeutic radioisotopes. These radioisotopes, while historically challenging to produce in quantities and for the cost that allow for robust growth of the field, are on the precipice of widespread clinical use for personalized cancer therapy. Nusano is uniquely positioned to support and foster the growth of this important application.*Nusano is founded on the idea that the greatest scientific asset isn’t raw material or technology but vision — and the freedom to follow that vision wherever it leads. So while the treatments of tomorrow will surely be built on advanced physics and sophisticated chemistry, they’ll be driven by creativity and fueled by spontaneity. In the world our technology enables, neither will have limits.
