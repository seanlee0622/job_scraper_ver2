Yes, this challenges the norm, but it means working with curious, purpose driven, dedicated, and inquisitively smart people who push themselves, our company and the community to the next level (and every level after that). We are the people behind the tech. And when it's good, we look for better. We don't over think the value we bring nor spend time trying to revamp mantras. We also do not come up with some crafty way to tell you who we are and what we offer. We are Nav! Here, you'll gain a wealth of experience, learn the tricks of the trade, and work with winners. All companies say people are connected to their mission but in our case our mission and our people are one – it is a way of being not just a cause you are committed to. And since 2013, Nav has holistically and organically developed its own ideology because Nav can only be Nav. *       WHAT WE EMPOWER YOU WITH: *      Own multiple areas of the MLE roadmap. Lead and contribute to projects on the MLE roadmap to advance Nav's business. Consult on projects of defined scope being performed by junior team members. *       Develop close relationships with stakeholders. Work with stakeholders to detail project design and timeline estimates.

In other words, we give small business owners access and control. Yes, this challenges the norm, but it means working with curious, purpose driven, dedicated, and inquisitively smart people who push themselves, our company and the community to the next level (and every level after that). We are the people behind the tech. And when it's good, we look for better. We don't over think the value we bring nor spend time trying to revamp mantras. We also do not come up with some crafty way to tell you who we are and what we offer. We are Nav! Here, you'll gain a wealth of experience, learn the tricks of the trade, and work with winners. All companies say people are connected to their mission but in our case our mission and our people are one – it is a way of being not just a cause you are committed to. And since 2013, Nav has holistically and organically developed its own ideology because Nav can only be Nav. *       WHAT WE EMPOWER YOU WITH: *      Own multiple areas of the MLE roadmap. Lead and contribute to projects on the MLE roadmap to advance Nav's business.

Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to infer biological relationships. By commanding massive experimental scale — up to millions of wet lab experiments weekly — and massive computational scale — owning and operating one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, Recursion is uniting technology, biology and chemistry to advance the future of medicine. *  Eight years ago, Recursion was manufacturing and staining plates by hand. Today, we're able to process and scan more than a million experiments every week. In the last year we've been able to take a compound from screen to preclinical data package in almost six months and put multiple molecules in the clinic with line of sight to our impact on patients. Next, we are building a Digital Chemistry team to help translate biology inferences to discovery leads and advance pharmaceutical projects in unprecedented fashion. Our drug discovery strategies are map and data-driven rather than target and exec-driven, revealing destinations you might never have considered. It is an audacious goal, but it isn't a dream or science fiction. We're already doing it! *  While we offer cutting-edge tools and an amazing lab, the secret sauce is our people.
