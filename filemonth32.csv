This assessment process results in cumbersome, clunky, and slow spreadsheets emailed back and forth — eating up info security resources and ultimately delaying deals.*  *   That’s where Whistic comes in. Our market-defining platform enables security and sales teams to proactively conduct and respond to third party security assessments by streamlining and automating the process, transforming the work for companies all over the world, saving professionals valuable time, and ultimately helping to safeguard sensitive information.*  *   Whistic is an Equal Opportunity Employer.* *","https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=a758a78e9e44c146&fccid=257a45ba69ddb87a&vjs=3","On-site","Part-time","MSCM",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"fe0b76cd15ea6233f4e040734232c2a5"
