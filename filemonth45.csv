The Sentinel Program is an enormous and complex “Mega-Project” modernizing the entire ICBM weapon system deployed across tens of thousands of square miles in five states. Without any doubt, Sentinel is one of the DoD’s most important acquisition efforts for the next decade, if not longer. It includes a complete refurbishment of hundreds of aging Minuteman III ICBM facilities to secure and support a newly designed, technologically advanced ballistic missile. It will also provide an entirely new command and control system as well as vast array of required support equipment specifically engineered to operate and sustain the new weapon system over the decades ahead. It enjoys broad, strong support at the national level. It is a long-term project - the weapon system will deploy over a nine-year period beginning in approximately 2026, and remain operational until at least 2075. Sentinel is a career-defining program that will present unique and challenging opportunities that simply are not available with smaller projects.Join an extraordinary company culture and the winning team to success this year and for years to come.Pursuant to Government contract, this position requires US Citizenship status.*  Required Education, Experience, & Skills* Bachelor's degree or higher in Engineering from an ABET accredited program, or Mathematics or Physics.
