At LiveView, we provide a fulfilling career that allows us to live our best life at work and at home.We provide the culture to work smart, have fun, and then get home to our families.*  *  If you want an opportunity for leadership, ownership, and accountability, and you're excited about contributing to a high-growth company that has a strong foundation where you can make an immediate impact, LiveView Technologies is the place for you!* *  Job Brief: *  You’re going to help make the world a safer place. LVT has found product-market fit, and your job is to get the various pieces of the system playing well enough together that our development teams can deliver value quickly and safely as measured by the DORA metrics. As you enable them to do that, you’ll help spread a product that is proven to reduce crime.* *  You’ll tear apart existing system boundaries, redesigning them with an eye towards high cohesion and low coupling. You’re able to break apart monolithic data models into autonomous data models. You won’t manage dependencies so much as you’ll eliminate them. You’ll figure out how to tell software components what to do rather than querying them for their data and making decisions.* *  You’ll work hand-in-hand with the VP of Product to execute on the Product Vision, making sure to deliver a software system that can respond to an ever-changing marketplace.* *  Who You Are: *  Your commitment and respect to your co-workers is manifest in your heart-of-a-teacher and in your servant-leader approach to your interactions. You bring psychological safety to everyone you interact with, rooted in the deep respect you have for your fellow human beings. Success to you means empowering others to shine in the spotlight.* *  You have relentless curiosity. Your experience gives you great starting points for investigating problems and solutions, but you recognize that your experience is limited. You recognize that you likely don’t fully understand your customers’ needs, so you work with them and Product Owners to understand. Only when you’ve worked side-by-side with your customers do you believe that you’re ready to design solutions to the validated problems you’ve observed. You then validate those solutions with your customers frequently, multiple times per day if you can, as they’re being built.*  *  You’re able to write code—production-grade code or proof-of-concept code as needed. You would be willing to work subject to the architectural decisions that you make. You’re able to do this because you’re just as comfortable jumping into a mob programming session with a team, taking your turns as Driver and then Navigator, as you are drafting and validating system-level design.* *  You understand the difference between principles and tools. TDD is about design more than it is about tests, and perhaps it ought to have been called test-driven design or consumer-driven design. Servers running automated tests are tools that help realize Continuous Integration, but they are not themselves CI. Infrastructure-as-code is a tool that helps realize the First Way of DevOps, but it is not itself DevOps.* *  You think in systems terms. Local optima don’t mean much to you because you’re trying to understand and optimize globally. You’re less concerned about individual efficiency (lines of code per developer) than you are making sure the work baton keeps moving. You understand that no section of a system is isolated, no matter how low-level it seems. Everything affects the User Experience eventually, and so you lead by example and validate with customers and our UX team to make sure that your designs won’t harm customers or damage their experience.* *  Job Duties and Responsibilities: * Drive the long-term vision and architecture of our Platform software by working in conjunction with Product Management.* Design, implement (code), review and troubleshoot embedded, server-side, and full web-stack software*  Help scale the platform to handle millions of IoT devices*  Mentor and coach team members *  Promote a strong culture of innovation within the group. Actively research, brainstorm, prototype, and present ideas.*  Provide technical guidance and influence in other areas of the Engineering (for example, Security, Test Engineering, Operations)*  Communicate the vision to key stakeholders inside and outside the org.*  Collaborate with partner teams and their architects/tech leads to achieve alignment* *  Required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities: * 12+ years of experience as a software developer, with hopefully a few as a Principal Developer or similar* Understanding of distributed systems, including the Fallacies of Distributed Systems and the countermeasures to each (i.e. the network is not reliable, so idempotence is necessary to ensure correctness)* Ability to effectively communicate your designs, knowing the right balance between judicious documentation and personal interaction, recognizing that a wiki is not a substitute for speaking with your co-workers* Familiarity with the autonomous, event-sourced flavor of microservices in the style of The Eventide Project or Greg Young* Experience with Lean and the Three Ways of DevOps, or at least the ability and willingness to learn them* You understand the DORA metrics (deployment frequency (DF), lead time for changes (LT), mean time to recovery (MTTR), and change failure rate (CFR)) and understand how different ways of organizing work will affect them* Ability to write production-grade code, preferably in languages such as Ruby, JavaScript, and Go, and the ability to at least read and grok C++, Java, Python, or Rust, that wouldn’t be a bad thing.* Ability to write proof-of-concept grade code in order to learn and knowing how to integrate that code into normal development workflow (hint: it isn’t by telling teams they must accept your proof-of-concept code)* Understanding of Lean concepts such as single-piece flow, limiting work-in-process, and the Theory of Constraints and how they apply to software development* *  Education and Training: * B.S. Computer Science or related field (MS/PhD preferred)* *  Benefits and HR Policy: *  Flex Time Off, Standard paid Holidays, health, vision, dental, and voluntary life insurance.
