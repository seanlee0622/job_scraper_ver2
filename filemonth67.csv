Each day holds a different adventure and a new challenge to solve.* Our development team works in a Kanban environment and takes issues from our prioritized board and works them to completion. Our backlog is full of different tasks including bugs, new feature development, integration with third-party providers, and occasionally architecting a new feature or enhancement.* Our code is primarily Java web applications running on Tomcat, with the use of Spring Framework for the bulk of our applications, so writing new code and possibly refactoring someone else’s code could be in your future.* But what about data? Well, we also store a bunch of data, so you’ll be working in a database frequently with DB technologies like PostgreSQL and Cassandra more frequently than not.* Not a fan of working on the backend code? Then we may have you work on the UI writing user functionality using Vue.js and creating new components for new functionality.* We run weekly “sprints” and commit and release code most Thursdays to production, so your code and your contributions will be used right out of the gate.*Requirements: What will I need to thrive in this role? If you’re passionate about healthcare and trying to transform the way doctors and patients communicate, coupled with a deep knowledge and understanding of Java web applications then we just might be right for you. We’re looking for folks who have 5+ years of experience in full-stack development using the Java EE Framework with Spring, and a depth of knowledge in reactive JS UI frameworks such as Vue to be part of an amazing team whose job it is to ensure that we are striving to transform healthcare. Your skills are going to be put to use building out innovative solutions to industry problems such as modernizing payments with providers and enabling real time communication to effect positive health outcomes. You should be proficient in looking at legacy code and finding ways to optimize and improve performance, increase security and stability as well as being able to work with a team on architecting a new product feature. You should bring your experience to the table and work collaboratively to find the best solution to whatever problem is presented. To be considered for this position you must be a US Citizen and reside in the United States due to legal requirements around data security.*****What does high performance look like in this role?***High performers are those who take ownership of the tasks they are assigned, bring up concerns and issues with designs and objectives early in the development process so the team can adapt quickly to those challenges. This person will also communicate to the rest of the team with an open mindset and help others grow from his or her prior experience and continually strive for defect-free code. High performers are able to complete tasks & tickets without supervision, and are able to jump in to solve problems or determine the source of issues as they arise.*What is my potential for career growth?Solutionreach is a local company that started here in Utah with humble beginnings. We’ve prided ourselves on hiring within and bringing up those who help the company and have the right skills and knowledge to continue that pattern. Your growth at Solutionreach is up to you, if you’re looking to rise through the ranks as a developer, great, we have that; if you’re looking for a leadership role, we have those too! Just be sure to speak with your manager about your career goals and we’ll work with you to make that happen.*What is the team like?We have a small but agile team of engineers who work great together, so of which have nearly 10 years of service. We like to have a good time, and have been known to incite mid-day Nerf-gun battles. The team works hard and checks their egos at the door, ensuring that there really isn’t a “dumb question”. Everyone on the team helps when asked and isn’t afraid of diving into the deep end where they aren’t familiar because they know they can ask for help and will get the support when they need it. The team works quickly and often on several different projects simultaneously, so it’s quite likely that at some point you’ll need to lean on your teammates' experience to solve the next ticket.*Sounds great. What else do I need to know?*Fast Evolution: Solutionreach evolves quickly and constantly to succeed as a business.

Each day holds a different adventure and a new challenge to solve.* Our development team works in a Kanban environment and takes issues from our prioritized board and works them to completion. Our backlog is full of different tasks including bugs, new feature development, integration with third-party providers, and occasionally architecting a new feature or enhancement.* Our code is primarily Java web applications running on Tomcat, with the use of Spring Framework for the bulk of our applications, so writing new code and possibly refactoring someone else’s code could be in your future.* But what about data? Well, we also store a bunch of data, so you’ll be working in a database frequently with DB technologies like PostgreSQL and Cassandra more frequently than not.* Not a fan of working on the backend code? Then we may have you work on the UI writing user functionality using Vue.js and creating new components for new functionality.* We run weekly “sprints” and commit and release code most Thursdays to production, so your code and your contributions will be used right out of the gate.*Requirements: What will I need to thrive in this role? If you’re passionate about healthcare and trying to transform the way doctors and patients communicate, coupled with a deep knowledge and understanding of Java web applications then we just might be right for you. We’re looking for folks who have 5+ years of experience in full-stack development using the Java EE Framework with Spring, and a depth of knowledge in reactive JS UI frameworks such as Vue to be part of an amazing team whose job it is to ensure that we are striving to transform healthcare. Your skills are going to be put to use building out innovative solutions to industry problems such as modernizing payments with providers and enabling real time communication to effect positive health outcomes. You should be proficient in looking at legacy code and finding ways to optimize and improve performance, increase security and stability as well as being able to work with a team on architecting a new product feature. You should bring your experience to the table and work collaboratively to find the best solution to whatever problem is presented. To be considered for this position you must be a US Citizen and reside in the United States due to legal requirements around data security.*****What does high performance look like in this role?***High performers are those who take ownership of the tasks they are assigned, bring up concerns and issues with designs and objectives early in the development process so the team can adapt quickly to those challenges. This person will also communicate to the rest of the team with an open mindset and help others grow from his or her prior experience and continually strive for defect-free code. High performers are able to complete tasks & tickets without supervision, and are able to jump in to solve problems or determine the source of issues as they arise.*What is my potential for career growth?Solutionreach is a local company that started here in Utah with humble beginnings. We’ve prided ourselves on hiring within and bringing up those who help the company and have the right skills and knowledge to continue that pattern. Your growth at Solutionreach is up to you, if you’re looking to rise through the ranks as a developer, great, we have that; if you’re looking for a leadership role, we have those too! Just be sure to speak with your manager about your career goals and we’ll work with you to make that happen.*What is the team like?We have a small but agile team of engineers who work great together, so of which have nearly 10 years of service. We like to have a good time, and have been known to incite mid-day Nerf-gun battles. The team works hard and checks their egos at the door, ensuring that there really isn’t a “dumb question”. Everyone on the team helps when asked and isn’t afraid of diving into the deep end where they aren’t familiar because they know they can ask for help and will get the support when they need it.
