Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.*  *   *  *  *   About Our Client *  *  *   *    The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust. *   *   *   *    The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart. *   *   *   *    Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture. *   *   *   *    What They're Building *   *   *    Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed. *   *   *   *    Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative *   *   *   *    About You *   *   *    You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of our work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our users. *     You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined. *     You have deep experience in building modern SPAs: structuring components, managing complex state (Redux/mobx/hook), *     modern JS (TypeScript, Flow, or ES8), build systems (webpack/etc). *     You're experienced in the presentation layer (modern HTML/CSS) and excited to build pixel-perfect interfaces. *     You're comfortable making small back-end changes from time to time to ship features end-to-end.*     *    *    *     How Our Client Works *    *    *     Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation. *      Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners. *      Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux. *     *     *      Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia. *     *    *    *    *     Base Salary Range: $150,000 to $200,000*    *    *      Benefits: Medical, Vision, Dental Coverage*    *   *  * *","https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=33e68208cef1ca89&fccid=09e02654c2f26bbd&vjs=3","Remote","Part-time","MSIS",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"96b17a0c414043c72783ca30a93bf5ef"
